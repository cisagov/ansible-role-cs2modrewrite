  # yamllint does not allow inline mappings that exceed the line length by
  # default. There are many scenarios where the inline mapping may be a key,
  # hash, or other long value that would exceed the line length but cannot
  # reasonably be broken across lines.
  line-length:
    # This rule implies the allow-non-breakable-words rule
    allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: true
    # Allows a 10% overage from the default limit of 80

  # yamllint doesn't like when we use yes and no for true and false,
